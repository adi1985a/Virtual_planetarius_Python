## üìÑ Overview

**SkyGazer: Python Interactive Virtual Planetarium**, developed by Adrian Lesniak, is a desktop application designed to bring the wonders of the night sky to your screen. This Python-based tool simulates an interactive star map, performing real-time position calculations for celestial objects. Users can explore constellations, get detailed information about stars by hovering over them, and navigate the cosmos using zoom functionalities. The application also features data export capabilities and a customizable interface through a `config.json` file.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Star Map**:
    *   Displays a dynamic map of the night sky.
    *   Calculates and renders the real-time or simulated positions of stars and other celestial objects.
*   ‚ú® **Constellation Visualization**:
    *   Clearly draws and labels major constellations, helping users identify and learn them.
*   ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Star Information on Hover**:
    *   When the user hovers the mouse cursor over a star, a tooltip or information panel displays relevant data (e.g., star name, magnitude, distance, spectral type).
*   üîç **Zoom Functionality**:
    *   Allows users to zoom in for detailed views of specific stars or constellations, and zoom out for a broader perspective of the sky.
*   üíæ **Data Export Capabilities**:
    *   Provides a mechanism to export data (e.g., current view coordinates, list of visible stars, user-marked objects) for further analysis or record-keeping. (The exact format and scope of export need to be defined by the implementation).
*   üé® **Customizable Interface**:
    *   User interface elements such as colors, window size, and font settings can be customized by editing a `config.json` file.
*   üåå **Real-Time or Simulated Sky**: The application can be configured to show the current sky based on system time and location (if implemented) or a simulated sky for a specific date/time/location.

## üïπÔ∏è Interactive Controls

*   **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in or out on the star map.
*   **Mouse Hover**: Hover the cursor over stars to display a pop-up or panel with detailed information about that star.
*   **Mouse Drag (Assumed)**: Likely allows users to pan across the star map by clicking and dragging.
*   **`ESC` Key**: Exit the planetarium application.
*   *(Additional controls for searching, toggling constellation lines/labels, changing time/date, or setting location might be present via keyboard shortcuts or UI buttons.)*

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots (Conceptual)

**Coming soon!**

_This section would ideally show screenshots of the SkyGazer application, including: the main star map view with constellations, an example of the star information pop-up on hover, the zoom functionality in action, and perhaps the settings interface if it's visual._

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements & Dependencies

### Software:
*   **Python**: Python 3.x (e.g., 3.6 or higher recommended).
*   **Libraries**: The `requirements.txt` file will specify the exact Python libraries needed. These typically include:
    *   A GUI library (e.g., `Pygame`, `Tkinter`, `PyQt5`, `Kivy`) for creating the window and handling graphics/events.
    *   A library for astronomical calculations (e.g., `Skyfield`, `Astropy`, or custom calculations).
    *   (Potentially `NumPy` for array operations, `Matplotlib` if any static charts are generated).
    *   (Potentially `Pillow` if image textures are used for celestial bodies).

### Operating System:
*   Any OS that supports Python 3.x and the required graphical libraries (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`config.json`)

The application's appearance and some behaviors can be customized by editing the `config.json` file located in the project directory. This file allows users to modify:

*   **Colors**: Define colors for background, stars, constellation lines, text, UI elements, etc.
*   **Window Size**: Set the initial width and height of the application window.
*   **Font Settings**: Specify font family, size, and style for text displayed in the application.
*   *(Potentially other settings like default zoom level, auto-start location/time, etc.)*

**Example `config.json` structure (conceptual):**
```json
{
  "window": {
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 720,
    "title": "SkyGazer - Virtual Planetarium"
  },
  "colors": {
    "background": "#000020",
    "stars": "#FFFFFF",
    "constellation_lines": "#404080",
    "info_text": "#E0E0E0"
  },
  "fonts": {
    "default_family": "Arial",
    "default_size": 12,
    "title_size": 16
  },
  "simulation": {
    "default_latitude": 0.0,
    "default_longitude": 0.0
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Ensure Python 3.x is Installed

Verify by typing the following in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

If not installed, download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

_Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with your actual project details._

### Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Required Libraries

With the virtual environment activated, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install manually (example):_

```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal (where `main.py` is located).  
Ensure your virtual environment is activated (if you created one).

Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
# or if using python3 alias:
python3 main.py
```

The **SkyGazer Virtual Planetarium** window should open, displaying the interactive star map.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure (Expected)

```plaintext
main.py               # Main script with GUI, logic, rendering, and events
config.json           # User-configurable settings (colors, size, fonts)
requirements.txt      # Dependency list
assets/ or data/      # (Optional) Star catalogs, textures, or constellation data
star_calculator.py    # (Optional) Astronomical calculations
gui_manager.py        # (Optional) GUI handling logic
config_loader.py      # (Optional) Loads JSON config
README.md             # Project documentation

## üìù Technical Notes

- **GUI Library**: Likely Pygame, suitable for real-time star rendering and interaction.
- **Astronomical Data**: Can come from:
  - Bundled files (CSV/JSON) with coordinates, magnitudes, names, etc.
  - External libraries like `Skyfield` or `Astropy`.
- **Coordinate Systems & Projections**:
  - Transforms celestial coordinates (RA/Dec) into screen space.
  - Uses map projections (e.g., gnomonic, stereographic).
- **Performance**:
  - Real-time rendering of many stars requires optimization.
  - Efficient data structures and rendering logic are crucial.
- **Data Export Capabilities** (if supported):
  - Define what and how (e.g., stars to CSV, images, selected object info).
